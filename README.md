# assignment4-NetBeansAndMaven

In this assignment we will be exposed to using a rich development environment like NetBeans to develop a multi-module application that leverages the Maven build tool.  

## About Maven 
Maven’s primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to attain this goal, Maven deals with several areas of concern such as: 
* Making the build process easy 
* Providing a uniform build system 
* Providing quality project information 
* Encouraging better development practices

## Exercises
1) In this first exercise you will learn how to create a multi-component Java application that 
leverages Maven and swing GUI interface. Follow the tutorial posted at 
https://www.codejava.net/ides/netbeans/create-multi-module-maven-project-netbeans and make 
certain that your code and results are uploaded to the GitHub repository.

2) Now leverage what you learned from the tutorial to refactor the cash register application 
that you wrote for assignment 3 and coded in NetBeans leveraging Maven. For this version of 
the cash register application you can simply code the Scanner and Display I/O and replicate 
the main Use Case that captures the following scenario “A small stand-alone Cash Register needs 
to be designed that reads barcodes of products that a Customer has selected and when a product 
has been identified, its name and price are displayed on a display. Use Java Swing to create 
the display. You can simulate the scanner using a GUI input pane where you manually enter a UPC code.
